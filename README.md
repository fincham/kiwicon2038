# kiwicon2038

If you played the Badge Challenge game at Kiwicon 2038 hopefully you got to play this. Built to run from an ISA option ROM on a Toshiba T3200SX (386).

Built with gcc 6.3.0, not sure how well it'll build elsewhere.

## Caveats

**But Michael, why is the code so weird?** Most of this code was the product of a lot of quality time with the Bochs debugger trying to convince gcc to actually generate a working binary, so just pretend any weirdness is out of necessity :D
